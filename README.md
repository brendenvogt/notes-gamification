# Notes on Gamification
This is a collection of thoughts and design principles around gamification using examples from real world games and apps, and employing real psychological principles, game theory, and statistics to explain the efficacy of gamification methods.

## Overarching Principles
- Principle 1. Create a sense of progression
  - based on psychological rush and affinity from completing tasks.
- Principle 2. Keep the player coming back for one more thing/turn.
  - Based on psychological need to finish uncompleted tasks.
  - Progress bars, daily quests, such as experience bars, trophies bars, token bars as in Brawl Stars.
  - Always another social media thing to consume. Main Feed, Stories Feed, Browse Page, Direct Messages.
- Principle 3. Everyone gets something. Everyone is above average. Create a positive sum game from a zero sum game.
  - As in Fortnite's, aggressive players are satisfied by being likely to find the best guns, the best power ups, and use those to their advantage to beat other opponents. Conservative players are satisfied by playing carefully enough to maintain their play style. Some play styles focus on high kill death ratio, others focus on being high on the leader-board. The battle royal game is very useful for serving varieties of players. 
- Principle 4. Create a sense of identity and community. Allow someone to grow their presence. 
  - Fortnite skins and dances
  - Among us pets and skins.

## Design Elements
### Element 1. Notifications and Indicators 
Notifications and indicators employ the psychological phenomena that humans have an affinity for uncompleted tasks. Everyone with a phone could recognize the red indicator with a number over apps on your phone telling you that you have things to do, emails to open, messages to read, posts to like. We recognize it when we see it, and we are happy when that notification is gone, or that indicator is cleared.
#### 1.a Progress Bars
- Examples
  - Linked in, Google, etc for profile completeness.
  - Long multi part forms on places like account sign up flows. Let the user know roughly how much longer it might take.

#### 1.b Simple Indicators
These can be as simple as a dot, or a number, or an animation. These are used generally to say "hey tap me, I have something new to show". These type of indicators are most effectively used when the user has a clear understanding of where to see the new updated information. If I see a number above an app, and I tap the app, I expect to see another indicator of where the updates are (e.g. a few notifications on the notifications tab, and a few on the messages section of the app, etc.)
- Examples
  - Instagram: Colorful circle around stories, small dot under the tab bar item that has some update.
  - Brawl Stars: Task indicators for each character showing you have a new challenges. 
  - Apple: Numbers of notifications for an app.

#### 1.c Push Notifications
Push notifications deliver a higher fidelity iteration on simple indicators. Push notifications tell users/players that something very specific has occurred. Tapping on that notification directly leads them to the update. 
- Examples
  - Amazon: "Your items are almost delivered, tap to see where your items are on a map."
  - Instagram: "User xyz just went live, tap to start watching"
  - Candy Crush: "Your hearts have now refreshed, play where you left off."

### Element 2. Identity
Skins, Dance moves, Pets, blue check marks, creating and encouraging a sense of identity and community can drive engagement and revenue.
- Example
  - Fortnite: skins and dance moves.
  - Brawl Stars: skins.
  - Among Us: pets, skins, and hats.
  - Instagram, Twitter, etc: Blue Checkmark.

## Study of "Fortnite" by Epic Games
### Overview
- Awesome overview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqG74aI9t3Q
Fortnite a free game brought in $1.8 billion in revenue for Epic Games in 2019, all from emotes and skins. Yeah! Well, and it might have to do with Fortnite's addictive use of psychology.

### Logical Progression
- Progress bars everywhere, 
  - Experience bar
  - Daily Quests
  - Progression

### Please Come Again
Fortnite encourages its players to play one more round. Through daily challenges or leveling, filling a progress bar harkens on the psychological tendency to automatically pick up unfinished tasks and remember more unfinished tasks, than completed ones. 

### Always Above Average
Fortnite serves two sets of players, the aggressive and the careful players. The aggressive players are satisfied by aggressively going for the high risk areas getting rewards first like the best guns, the best upgrades, etc. The second set of players are satisfied by achieving the high probability of staying alive until the final stages. The aggressive, high risk players have accepted the risk that they might die more frequently and quicker than most, but the payoff is much more exhilarating than the losses. The careful players are averse to loss, and therefor limit their exposure to risks that come with hot zones, and high traffic areas. Their payoff is focussed on the high kill:death ratio, or the high ranking on the leader-board in hopes that they survive till the very end. In short, Fortnite serves both sets of players in parallel. 


## Study of "Brawl Stars" by SuperCell
### Overview
Brawl Stars is a top down mobile online multiplayer battle arena shooter.  The games types are fun, and can leave you spending more time than you originally intended.  This is not by chance, the game was designed with a number of gamification strategies to make you play longer and spend more money. 

### Progress Everywhere
There are so many progress bars in Brawl Stars, it is sometimes silly. Here is a list of all the progress bars I could see in the game:
- Progress bar for each character's trophies in the game.
- Progress bar for each character's next unlock level. 
- Progress number for each character's power level.
- Progress bar for overall trophy progress.
- Progress bar for experience level
- Progress bar for next box unlock.
- Count down timer till next round of map events (new maps, and extra tokens for discovery)
- Count down timer till more tokens are available
- Achievement tasks indicating things to be done.
- Progress bars for each quest. (e.g. "Win 3 Games in Gem Grab")
- Count down timer for the refreshing of daily quests
- Count down timer for the refreshing of Season Quests
- Count down timer for the refreshing of Special Event Quests
- Progress bar for next Brawl pass unlock.

#### Secondary effects
- waiting for new map events, makes you tap on the maps to get tokens, new tokens could unlock a box, opening a box could get you more coins, power points, gems, etc. getting more things could allow you to unlock a new level, or level up a character. Leveling up a character makes you want to play with that newly upgraded character.

### Money? What Money?
Brawl Stars does a great job of abstracting physical money and making it near impossible to track how much something in game actually costs in dollars and cents. 
- Big Box = 30 gems = $1.99 (easy calculation because 30 gems is the lowest tier for gems)
- Mega Box = 80 gems = $4.99 (easy calculation because 80 gems is the second lowest tier for gems)
- Token Doubler = 40 gems = ~ 2-2.5 Dollars but really you can either buy 2 packs of $1.99 or one pack of $4.99. so really that 40 gems costs you 4-5 dollars.- 
- Star Points (Cannot be bought?)
- Coins (Can only be bought by Gems)  
  - assuming most popular of 9.99/170  
  - 20 gems / 150 coins = 7.5 coins per gem 
  - 50 gems / 400 coins = 8 coins per gem (marked "6% EXTRA") 
  - 140 gems / 1200 coins = 8.6 coins per gem (marked "14% EXTRA") 
  - 280 gems / 2600 coins = 9.3 coins per gem (marked "23% EXTRA")
- Gems (Can only be bought by Dollars)  
  - 1.99/30 = 6.6 cents per gem  
  - 4.99/80 = 6.2 cents per gem  
  - 9.99/170 = 5.9 cents per gem (marked "Most Popular")  
  - 19.99/360 = 5.6 cents per gem  
  - 49.99/950 = 5.3 cents per gem  
  - 99.99/2000 = 5 cents per gem (marked "Best Value")

- Gamblers Fallacy 
  - The thought that seemingly skewed outcomes will lead to a correction to the mean in future outcomes.
  - e.g. Flipping a coin and 50/100 tosses land heads, the fallacy would suggest the next 50 tosses should land tails because the probability of heads vs tails is 50:50.
- Sid Meyer 2010 GDQ Talk on Psychology of Game Design 
  - Create a sense of linear progression
  - Make the player constantly want to play one more turn
  - Make the player feel above average. 
- Zeigarnik and Ovsiankina Effects
  - Zeigarnik Effect - humans are more likely to remember unfinished or interrupted tasks more than completed ones
    - You'll never complete every progress bar or get every skin or power up, character icon, weapon etc.
  - Ovsiankina Effect - humans have the tendency to pick up uncompleted tasks without prompting, and often without a sense of thinking about it.
    - I want to play a game but I don't know what to play. Oh I will level up my character since I am so close.
    - Oh I'm just a few points away from getting that achievement.
- Flow
  - Doing things without much conscious thought 
  - e.g. minecraft, building a giant building without much conscious thought, more like smaller more spread out bits of conscious thought.
  - Skinner Conditioning (Operant Conditioning Models) - Proactive
    - Train a dog to ring a bell to get a treat
  - Pavlov Conditioning - Reactive - Pavlov's dog got a treat after hearing a bell.
    - Train a dog to want a treat after the sound of a bell.
  - Randomness
    - A key aspect to enhancing learned behavior is to introduce rewards with randomness. Give rewards every single time and the rush of hitting it big diminishes. Never give a reward and the rush never happens at all or the player looses interest eventually.
    - Fortnite does this by introducing loot to pick up randomly over the entire map. Every building is an opportunity to get the best gun in the map, or a resupply of items. Essentially turning the entire map into a giant loot box filled with operant conditioning rewards.
