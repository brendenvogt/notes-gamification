# Notes on Gamification
This is a collection of thoughts and design principles around gamification and examples from real world studies on leaders who employ gamification well in their products. This study pulls from psychology, game theory, and statistics in order to explain the phenomena.

## Overarching Principles
- Create a sense of progression
  - based on psychological rush from completing tasks.
- Keep the player coming back for one more thing.
  - Based on psychological need to finish uncompleted tasks.
  - Theres always another progress bar or quest to complete in Brawl Stars.
  - Always another social media thing to consume. Main Feed, Stories Feed, Browse Page, Direct Messages.
  - Daily Challenges, Daily Quests, etc.
- Everyone is a winner. Create a positive sum game from a zero sum game (Always make the player feel above average)
  - Fortnite does this excellently by its battle royal game type. For those who want to play aggressive and risk getting killed quickly, they are satisfied because they want the joy of the action. If they die they hop back into another game and try all over. On the other hand if a player wants to play conservatively and make that one game last as long as possible they could play carefully and get in the top 3 or top 2. Everyone has a sense of being above average. Or getting more out of the game than the other players. In other words a positive sum game.


- Create a sense of identity and community. Allow someone to grow their presence.
  - Fortnite skins and dances
  - Among us pets and skins.

## Design Elements
- Progress bars
  - Linked in, Google, etc for profile completeness.
  - Long multi part forms on places like account sign up flows. Let the user know roughly how much longer it might take.
- Task Indicators 
  - red notification number as on iPhone apps
  - Colorful circle around stories for Instagram
  - Task clip board icon in Brawl Stars you have a task available
- Skins, Dance moves, Pets.
  - Fortnite skins and dance moves.
  - Brawl Stars Skins.
  - Among Us pets, skins, and hats.

## Study of "Fortnite" by Epic Games
### Overview
- Awesome overview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqG74aI9t3Q
Fortnite a free game brought in $1.8 billion in revenue for Epic Games in 2019, all from emotes and skins. Yeah! Well, and it might have to do with Fortnite's addictive use of psychology.

### Logical Progression
- Progress bars everywhere, 
  - Experience bar
  - Daily Quests
  - Progression
### Please Come Again

### Always Above Average



## Study of "Brawl Stars" by SuperCell
### Overview
Brawl Stars is a top down mobile online multiplayer battle arena shooter.  The games types are fun, and can leave you spending more time than you originally intended.  This is not by chance, the game was designed with a number of gamification strategies to make you play longer and spend more money. 

### Progress Everywhere
There are so many progress bars in Brawl Stars, it is sometimes silly. Here is a list of all the progress bars I could see in the game:
- Progress bar for each character's trophies in the game.
- Progress bar for each character's next unlock level. 
- Progress number for each character's power level.
- Progress bar for overall trophy progress.
- Progress bar for experience level
- Progress bar for next box unlock.
- Count down timer till next round of map events (new maps, and extra tokens for discovery)
- Count down timer till more tokens are available
- Achievement tasks indicating things to be done.
- Progress bars for each quest. (e.g. "Win 3 Games in Gem Grab")
- Count down timer for the refreshing of daily quests
- Count down timer for the refreshing of Season Quests
- Count down timer for the refreshing of Special Event Quests
- Progress bar for next Brawl pass unlock.


#### Secondary effects
- waiting for new map events, makes you tap on the maps to get tokens, new tokens could unlock a box, opening a box could get you more coins, power points, gems, etc. getting more things could allow you to unlock a new level, or level up a character. Leveling up a character makes you want to play with that newly upgraded character.

- Gamblers Fallacy 
  - The thought that seemingly skewed outcomes will lead to a correction to the mean in future outcomes.
  - e.g. Flipping a coin and 50/100 tosses land heads, the fallacy would suggest the next 50 tosses should land tails because the probability of heads vs tails is 50:50.
- Sid Meyer 2010 GDQ Talk on Psychology of Game Design 
  - Create a sense of linear progression
  - Make the player constantly want to play one more turn
  - Make the player feel above average. 
- Zeigarnik and Ovsiankina Effects
  - Zeigarnik Effect - humans are more likely to remember unfinished or interrupted tasks more than completed ones
    - You'll never complete every progress bar or get every skin or power up, character icon, weapon etc.
  - Ovsiankina Effect - humans have the tendency to pick up uncompleted tasks without prompting, and often without a sense of thinking about it.
    - I want to play a game but I don't know what to play. Oh I will level up my character since I am so close.
    - Oh I'm just a few points away from getting that achievement.
- Flow
  - Doing things without much conscious thought 
  - e.g. minecraft, building a giant building without much conscious thought, more like smaller more spread out bits of conscious thought.
  - Skinner Conditioning (Operant Conditioning Models) - Proactive
    - Train a dog to ring a bell to get a treat
  - Pavlov Conditioning - Reactive - Pavlov's dog got a treat after hearing a bell.
    - Train a dog to want a treat after the sound of a bell.
  - Randomness
    - A key aspect to enhancing learned behavior is to introduce rewards with randomness. Give rewards every single time and the rush of hitting it big diminishes. Never give a reward and the rush never happens at all or the player looses interest eventually.
    - Fortnite does this by introducing loot to pick up randomly over the entire map. Every building is an opportunity to get the best gun in the map, or a resupply of items. Essentially turning the entire map into a giant loot box filled with operant conditioning rewards.
